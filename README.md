# 🚀 CodeChronicles

Welcome to **CodeChronicles** — a living journal where I document my problem-solving journey in Python.  
This isn’t just a collection of solutions — it’s my way of breaking down problems, writing out the logic, and making sure I truly **understand the "why" behind the code**.

---

## 🎯 What I'm Doing Here
- Practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms** consistently 🟢
- Writing clean, well-documented solutions
- Explaining my thought process, approaches, and trade-offs
- Creating a reference I (and others) can revisit to understand patterns

---

## 🗂 Repository Layout
- **Arrays/** → Searching, sorting, subarray problems  
- **LinkedList/** → Singly/Doubly linked list implementations and patterns  
- **Trees/** → Traversals, BST operations, recursion strategies  
- **Graphs/** → BFS, DFS, shortest path, connectivity  
- **DynamicProgramming/** → Classic DP challenges & reusable patterns  
- **Notes/** → Strategy write-ups, key insights, and pattern recognition  
- **Progress/** → Logs explaining how I approached specific problems  
- **Templates/** → Boilerplate for quick starts

---

## 📊 How I Track Progress
Instead of just storing code, I keep **logs** that explain:
- The **approach I chose** (and why)  
- **Complexity analysis** (time/space)  
- **Traps & insights** I discovered along the way  

| Problem             | Topic        | My Notes? |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Two Sum             | Arrays       | ✅ |
| Reverse Linked List | LinkedList   | ✅ |
| Fibonacci (DP)      | DynamicProgramming | ✅ |
| ...                 | ...          | ... |

## ✨ Why I’m Doing This
I believe solving problems is not just about writing code that works — it’s about developing a **way of thinking**.  
By documenting my understanding, I make sure I can explain solutions clearly, apply patterns to new problems, and show consistent growth over time.
